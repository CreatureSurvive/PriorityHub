New Features

Notificaion center support?
    Would need to decouple PH views etc. from the lock screen
    Would need to restructure settings pane to separate lock screen & notification center
    Add option to auto-clear notifs from an app when it's launched - notifications are mostly irrelevant after an app has been opened
Add setting to use native pull to refresh view
Add setting to clear app badges when clearing from lockscreen? (see markasread7 source code on github)
Add option to open to currently selected app?
Add setting to hide app icon if only one notification/notifications from one app are present? (probably no, code would be messy)
Add help section in settings with detailed descriptions of each setting
Option for icons on the side?
